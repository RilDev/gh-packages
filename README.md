## Installation

```
npm i gh-packages -D
```

In order to always have the latest version, you can run `gh-pages` with `npx`. It will run it without installing it on your machine.

```
npx gh-packages
```

If you choose to do it this way, remember to always add `npx` in front of every `gh-packages` commandes.

## Usage

To publish your package to NPM simply run `gh-packages` inside your package's directory:

```
cd your-package
gh-packages
```

This command will patch your version number in your package.json, commit it and push it. It will then create a branch gh-packages and publish it to NPM. And finally, switch you back to you original branch.

This is what the log will look like:

### Options

```
gh-packages [patch|minor|major] [-c|--command]
```

#### Version Number Update:

With `gh-packages` you can choose how the version number will be updated: patch, minor or major.

You can read about semantic versioning here: [semver.org](https://semver.org/)

__Patch Update:__ A patch is used to indicate a small change like a bug fix or an improvement to the documentation. For instance, asuming the current version is `0.0.3`, if I update the `readme.md` file, I will do a patch update. The new version would be `0.0.4`.

By default, `gh-packages` will perform a pacth update.

```
gh-packages
```

or

```
gh-packages patch
```

__Minor Update:__ A minor update indicates a new functionality, like a new option for a CLI for example. If the version number was `0.0.3` before the minor update, it will become `0.1.0`.

```
gh-packages minor
```

__Major Update:__ A major update is a new functionality that will break existing functionalities. If you decide to rename options or that you remove an option, then it would be a major update. If the version number was `0.0.3` before the update, it will become `1.0.0`.

```
gh-packages major
```

#### User Command:

It is possible to define a `bash` command by using the `--command` or `-c` flag that will be executed on the `packages` branch.

```
gh-packages -c 'rm -r docs && mv styles.css styles.min.css'
```

This functionality makes it a breeze to `rename` files and to `delete` unnecessary code. Making the package bundle smaller.
